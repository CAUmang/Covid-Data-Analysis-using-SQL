# Covid-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
I have analysed Covid Deaths and Vaccinations data for whole world using SQLiteStudio. I run the queries in SQL to extract the required Datasets from the whole Datadump and used Tableau to visualise those datasets.
During the process, I learned the basic syntax in SQLite to perform the CRUD operations and got a hold of running basic SQL queries.
